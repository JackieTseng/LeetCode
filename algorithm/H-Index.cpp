/*********************************************************************************
 * Leetcode : H-Index  -- https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
 * Coded in Seq 4th, 2015
 *
 * [Problem]
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
 * his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more
 * than h citations each."
 * 
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5
 * papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 * Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two
 * with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 * 
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * 
 * Hint:
 * 
 * An easy approach is to sort the array first.
 * What are the possible values of h-index?
 * A faster approach is to use extra space.
